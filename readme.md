# Binder-collab

This repository contains public, easy-to-use developments created to support users of the PSI neutron source facilities, particularly SINQ.

The goal is to provide simple and accessible code examples that help users run simulations or analyze data without needing prior programming experience. These notebooks and scripts are designed to run directly in a web browser using Google Colab or project-specific tools, with no software installation required.
